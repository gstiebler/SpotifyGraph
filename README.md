# Spotify Artist Graph Visualizer

This application allows you to visualize the graph of artists on Spotify.
The artists are represented as nodes and the edges are the connections between them.
The list of your artists comes from the artists in you saved tracks.
The connections are determined by the "related artists" feature on Spotify.
