# Spotify Graph Visualizer

This project lets you visualize your Spotify listening history as a graph of interconnected artists. Discover new music and explore the relationships between your favorite musicians!

## How it works
1. **Connect to Spotify:**  Authorize the application to access your Spotify account.
2. **Analyze your listening:** The app fetches your top artists and uses the Spotify API to find related artists.
3. **Generate a graph:**  A visual representation of your musical taste is created, with artists as nodes and "related artist" connections as edges.
4. **Explore your connections:**  See how your favorite artists are interconnected and discover new music through their relationships.
